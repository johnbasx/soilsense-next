      {
        "question": "What is the most important thing about soil?",
        "answer": "Soil plays an important role in both air and water quality. Poor quality soil that is not covered with plants or residues blows with the wind, causing dust storms. It will erode with the rain, adding nutrients to streams, rivers and lakes, and makes them muddy. Soil that has good quality resists wind and water erosion. The rain that falls on good quality soil moves into the ground to be used by plants, or to recharge aquifers. The water is purified as it moves through the soil because the soil is a natural filter that removes pollutants in three ways: chemically, physically, and biologically. Clay particles in soil have a negative charge, and they attract positively charged pollutants and hold them in the soil. Most heavy metal pollutants have positive charges and so are chemically trapped in soils so they do not reach water tables"

        "answer": "Technology? Wow! What a question! Soil scientists work with many types of technology, from extremely simple (hands, picks, and water bottles) to extremely complex. Some of the advanced technologies include: geographic positioning systems, geographic information systems, laser surveying systems, infrared thermometry, multispectral imagery, X-ray spectroscopy (mineralogists), several types of spectrophotometers (atomic absorption, plasma emission, etc.; fertility and environmental specialists), respirometers (biologists studying the activity of soil organisms), time domain reflectometry and various types of psychrometry (soil physicists studying water in the soil)"
