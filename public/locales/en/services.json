    "about": "Soil is central to human wellbeing through its provision of critical ecosystem services, including food and clean water. These services emerge through the self-organising nature of the soil system. Here, we consider the lessons learnt from the evolution of the understanding of human and ecosystem health for the conceptualisation and application of soil health. We share the fundamental and practical challenges of managing the land with respect to soil health, and the need for policy to drive the protection of soil as one of our most important non-renewable natural resources.",
